- In scheduling, start_time and end_time should both be after whatever time it is right now. 
- Unit tests for SDXExceptions edge cases.
- Read over sdx_client and see if any support functions can be removed to another file. 
- Finish the README.
- Is this on MIT license?
- Configure logger with a specific format and potentially output to files or other logging services.
- Extract attribute validation to separate modules and methods. 
- There's some repetition in the methods dealing with API requests. Consider creating a helper method to handle common request logic (e.g., setting up headers, handling responses, caching).
- Look in to `mypy` to ensure type safety across codebase.
- Ensure logging is consistent and at appropriate levels (info, debug, error). This will help in monitoring and debugging when running client in production.
- Create a class for the API return object. 
- Create additional notebooks to fully explore all of the attributes and addtional error handling. 
- In the scheduling setter, the TypeError bothers me. It looks like it is unreachable and I can't figure out how to fix that.
